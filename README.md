SamuDash, a Pygame passion project. As someone who has been a part of the gaming circle for more than a decade now, it was always a dream of mine to learn how to make one. 

The game is a fast paced, 2D platformer using an 8bit art style, something I've always been a fan of.

Some of the Core Features include:
Custom tilemap engine
Fluid player movement (double jump, wall-slide, dash!)
Dynamic enemy AI with projectile combat
Atmospheric clouds & particle effects
3 Playable Maps
